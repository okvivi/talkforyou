This website does not store any passwords or personal information.

I will never spam you or your friends with invitations, and I will not post 
anything to your wall.

<br><br>
I do store the playlist on my server, which means that the list of videos
that you and your friends posted to their walls is for the moment kept on
my server, plus some information about which songs you've already listened to
and stuff like that.
