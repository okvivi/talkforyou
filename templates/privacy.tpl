This website does not store any passwords or personal information.

I will never spam you or your friends with invitations, and it will ask you
for permission before writing anything to Facebook.

I do store the playlist on my server, which means that the list of videos
that you and your friends posted to their walls is for the moment kept on
my server, plus some information about which songs you've already listened to
and stuff like that.
