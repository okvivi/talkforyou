  <b>About this website</b><br>
  This is just a nerdy hack that pulls all the videos shared by your facebook
  friends and tries to play them continuously back to you, like a radio. I've
  built it because I find this idea useful, and I hope you do too.
  <br>
  I am currently mostly playing around and I've had to go around some
  limitations of the facebook api, but I'll try to make it better if this gets
  any attention.
